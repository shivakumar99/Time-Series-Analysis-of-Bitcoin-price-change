## Project Structure

- **Data Loading and Exploration**:  
   - Data is loaded using `pandas` and explored to understand key metrics.
   - Key columns in the dataset:
     - `Date`: The date of the trading day.
     - `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`: Prices at different stages of the day.
     - `Volume`: The trading volume.
     - `Market Cap`: Market capitalization on the given day.
   - Statistical summaries help in understanding central tendencies and variations in Bitcoin prices.

- **Data Cleaning**:
   - The `Date` column is converted to `datetime64` format.
   - The dataset is cleaned from null values and duplicates.

- **Data Sorting**:  
   - Data is chronologically sorted for accurate time series visualization.

- **Data Visualization**:
   - **Line Plots**: Created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for key price indicators over time.
   - **Candlestick Chart**: Created using Plotlyâ€™s `go.Candlestick` function, this provides a detailed view of the price behavior over a sample of 50 days.

## Data

The dataset used contains daily Bitcoin price data from April 2013 to July 2017. Key columns include:
- **Date**: Trading date.
- **Open**: Opening price of Bitcoin on the given day.
- **High**: Highest price reached on the day.
- **Low**: Lowest price reached on the day.
- **Close**: Closing price of Bitcoin on that day.
- **Volume**: Amount of Bitcoin traded during the day.
- **Market Cap**: Total value of Bitcoin in the market on that day.

## Visualizations

- **Line Charts**: Visualize the `Open`, `High`, `Low`, and `Close` prices over the entire dataset.
  
  Example:
  ```python
  plt.figure(figsize=(20, 12))
  for index, col in enumerate(['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close'], 1):
      plt.subplot(2, 2, index)
      plt.plot(data['Date'], data[col])
      plt.title(col)
